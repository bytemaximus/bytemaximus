## About Me

I'm a Java backend engineer by day, turning caffeine into code and numbers into profits. 
When I'm not at the keyboard, I'm orchestrating beats in my studio, hacking my home to be smart, exploring the cosmos (or at least watching space documentaries), and proving that the only thing I crunch more than code is the nutrition facts on my protein bars.
